i wonder what its like to be you, to be so envious of other people's bodies, yet you dont even try that hard to change your own for the better. i know that you know youre not trying hard enough. So hold up your promise to yourself. Try harder, be thinner, get to a point in life when youre skinny enough to truly love yourself. cross to the other side, become the person people are envious of rather than someone  who envies others. you can do this. if you really want this, then you wont screw it up
